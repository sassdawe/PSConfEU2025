# Building SOC Tools on Stage

In a purely Defender XDR based Security Operations Center, repetitive workflows executed in the browser are more than an annoyance—they’re a risk. To make things works SOC environments are usually high on stress, and demand efficiency and accuracy, not time-wasting tasks like copy-paste and looking information up at multiple places and across multiple browser tabs.

In this session, I’ll demonstrate how I used PowerShell Notebooks to develop tools that eliminated almost all of this browser based repetitive work, increased efficiency, and enhanced incident response. Expect live demos of tools in use, all designed to scale SOC capabilities without adding licensing costs.
