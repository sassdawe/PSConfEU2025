# Winget inside Intune remediation scripts

Are you struggling to justify yet another subscription at work while bored to death by managing updates for the various software used across your organization?

In this session, we’ll explore how to integrate Winget into PowerShell scripts and deliver them to your Windows devices using Intune’s remediation scripts feature. We’ll also cover techniques for gathering logs and other complex information, tasks that would otherwise require paid add-ons from the Intune Suite.
