## Winget inside Intune remediation scripts

Are you struggling to justify yet another subscription at work while bored to death by managing updates for the various software used across your organization?

In this session, we’ll explore how to integrate Winget into PowerShell scripts and deliver them to your Windows devices using Intune’s remediation scripts feature. We’ll also cover techniques for gathering logs and other complex information, tasks that would otherwise require paid add-ons from the Intune Suite.

## VS Code Extension Deployment with Intune

The VS Code extension marketplace is a double-edged sword: it gives us countless extensions which make our lives a lot easier, but on the other hand it contains malicious extensions impersonating popular tools or just plain simple info stealers. This means there is a significant risk that these extensions can leak your developer credentials together with your source code, and as is stands today we lack a clear way to manage these risk.

In this session, we’ll design and implement a governance solution using the combination of PowerShell, CI/CD workflows, pipelines, and artifacts together with code scanning, and finally with Intune to mitigate these risks. By the end, you’ll have a framework adaptable to other package ecosystems like NuGet and npm, bringing a scalable, enterprise-ready layer of security to your development workflows.

## Building SOC Tools on Stage

In a purely Defender XDR based Security Operations Center, repetitive workflows executed in the browser are more than an annoyance—they’re a risk. To make things works SOC environments are usually high on stress, and demand efficiency and accuracy, not time-wasting tasks like copy-paste and looking information up at multiple places and across multiple browser tabs.

In this session, I’ll demonstrate how I used PowerShell Notebooks to develop tools that eliminated almost all of this browser based repetitive work, increased efficiency, and enhanced incident response. Expect live demos of tools in use, all designed to scale SOC capabilities without adding licensing costs.

Prerequisite: Watch Execute Notebooks Everywhere from PSConfEU 2024. This session will arm you with actionable insights to improve your SOC’s performance and drive down costs.
